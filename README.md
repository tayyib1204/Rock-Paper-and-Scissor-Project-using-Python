# Rock-Paper-and-Scissor-Project-using-Python
I have started learning python and I have made a basic project using python i.e, Rock, Paper and Scissor
I have used Nested IF-ELSE statement
Firstly I imported a python library, random using import random.
random function gives random numbers between selected starting and ending numbers

I have taken 3 variables rock, paper and scissor and assigned strikers for those three variables.
Created a list of three variables with a variable name, 'game_images'.
0 - Rock
1 - Paper
2 - Scissor

There should be user input and computer input. Depending upon the two inputs we decide who is winner. 
user input will be taken using input function.
Computer input will be taken using random.randint function

If a user enter a number other than 0, 1, 2. It will print as "Enter a number between 0 1 2.
In ELSE part I used nested if to give all conditions of the game.
If user input is equal to 0 and computer is equal to 2
it print as 'You win'

If user input is equal to 2 and computer is equal to 0
it print as 'You loss'.

if user choice is greater than computer choice
'You win'

if computer choice is greater than user choice
'You loss'

if both inputs are equal,
it print as 'Draw'

user_choice > 2 or user_choice <0) and (computer_choice >2 or computer_choice < 0
it print as 'You have entered wrong input'

If any of the coditions are not satisfies, in else part we print as 'You have entered wrong input'
